# Servelytica - Sports Analytics Platform

## Overview
Servelytica is a comprehensive sports analytics platform built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and PostgreSQL (Neon). The platform provides video analysis, coaching services, and social connectivity for athletes and coaches.

## ⚠️ Migration Status (Updated: November 21, 2025)
**Current State**: PARTIAL MIGRATION - Database schema migrated to Neon, but application code still uses Supabase client

**Completed:**
✅ Database schema fully migrated to Neon PostgreSQL
✅ Drizzle ORM configured and working
✅ All 30+ tables created in Neon database
✅ Supabase npm packages removed

**Remaining Work:**
⚠️ Authentication system needs replacement (currently uses Supabase Auth)
⚠️ 50+ files contain Supabase client calls that need API endpoints
⚠️ File storage solution needed for video uploads
⚠️ Real-time features need implementation (chat, notifications)

**📋 See `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` for detailed migration guide and next steps**

## Project Architecture

## Database Schema

### Hybrid Database Architecture
The application now supports a **hybrid database approach**:

1. **Neon PostgreSQL (Primary - via Replit)**
   - Located at: `server/db.ts` (Drizzle connection)
   - Schema defined in: `shared/schema.ts` (Drizzle schema)
   - Type-safe queries using Drizzle ORM
   - Connected via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   
2. **Supabase (Secondary - for Auth/Storage/Realtime)**
   - Auth, Storage, and Realtime features still use Supabase
   - Legacy database queries can still use Supabase client
   - Located in: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`

### Database Tables (30+ tables)
Key tables include:
- **User Management**: profiles, user_roles, activity_log
- **Video Analysis**: videos, video_feedback, motion_analysis_data, stroke_types
- **Coaching**: coach_profiles, coach_specialties, coach_availability, coach_reviews
- **Social**: connections, connection_requests, chats, chat_messages
- **Blog/Community**: blog_articles, blog_categories, blog_tags, article_tags, comments
- **Subscriptions**: memberships, subscription_plans, pricing_tiers
- **Notifications**: notifications, notification_preferences
- **Analytics**: analytics_events

### Schema Management
```bash
# Push schema changes to Neon database
npm run db:push

# Generate migrations (if needed)
npm run db:generate

# Test database connections
npx tsx server/test-db.ts
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm

### ⚠️ REQUIRED: Supabase Storage Bucket Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Before video uploads will work, you MUST create the storage bucket in Supabase.

**Steps to set up video storage:**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pxzlivocnykjjikkjago
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.sql` (in the root directory)
4. Paste and run the SQL in the editor
5. Verify the bucket was created by going to **Storage** in the sidebar

**Why this is needed:**
- The video upload feature requires a storage bucket named 'videos'
- This bucket stores all user-uploaded videos
- Without this bucket, video uploads will fail with storage errors

### Environment Variables

**Required (Auto-configured by Replit):**
- `DATABASE_URL`: Neon PostgreSQL connection string (set automatically by Replit)
- `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`: Postgres credentials (set automatically)

**Optional (for Supabase features):**
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key (for client-side auth)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Supabase service role key (for server-side operations)

**Note**: The Supabase connection is currently configured in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` with hardcoded values for the existing Supabase project.

### Running Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application runs on port 5000 and is accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

### Build
```bash
npm run build        # Production build
npm run build:dev    # Development build
```

## Replit Configuration

### Workflows
- **Start application**: Runs `npm run dev` on port 5000 with webview output

### Vite Configuration
The Vite dev server is configured to:
- Listen on `0.0.0.0:5000` (required for Replit)
- Use HMR with clientPort 443 for proper hot reload in Replit's proxy environment
